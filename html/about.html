From seeing the images and general descriptions of the items they have, to keeping track of the days left before rent is due and having a complete history of when the unit is accessed to what items are placed inside or removed, to even a system where they could generate an alternative, and having a digital key to access their storage unit, E-Tabi has many convenient features as long as they are utilized to their full potential.</p><br></div>
